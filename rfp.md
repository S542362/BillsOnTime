Since the user will already be logged in, the upcoming bill name and date will be displayed on the home page. 
If the user wants to see all the upcoming bills at a time in a month, the user needs to hit on "Continue" button on the bottom of the display.
For updating bills, the user need to click on "addbill" button, which takes the user to calendar, then the user needs to select the following date

so that the user can fill in personal bills like dentist bill, amazon bill or any such things. In addition there is recursive option, 
Every Month or Current Month, so that the bills repeat according to the option we select. Thus, the purpose of the application is full filled by
